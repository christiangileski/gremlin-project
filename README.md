# Gremlin Project

This is a small project to meet the requirements of the Gremlin take home assessment found [here](https://github.com/gremlin/frontend-take-home?tab=readme-ov-file#example-api-request)

I've used the following modules to complete the assessment:

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) to bootstrap the React application.
- [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) because it's the best library for making http requests.
- [use-debounce](https://github.com/xnimorz/use-debounce) because it's the best library for debouncing using hooks.
- [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/) because it's the best lightweight javascript date library.

## Instructions

1. Clone this repository.
2. In the project directory, run `npm install` (or similar package manager installation script) to install the project dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` (or similar package manager dev script) to run the project in dev mode.
4. Alternatively, run `npm run build` then `npm run preview` (or similar package manager scripts) to run a production version of the app.
